# PlayingWithDates

This program reads in a bunch of dates and prints them in  ways. 

It will show a default format of x/x/xxxx, a long format, Mon, xx, xxxx, a two digit format, xx,xx,xxxx, and a Julian Date format. The main file for this is mostly a test driver, ensuring it is working correctly as well as throwing it incorrect dates and formats to ensure it defaults to the main constructor. At the end it asks users to enter a date of their own choosing to do the same.
